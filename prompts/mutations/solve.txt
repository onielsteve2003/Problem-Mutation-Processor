Write a complete, properly indented Python function that solves this problem: "{problem}"

Requirements:
1. Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
2. Include a function definition with proper parameters
3. Initialize all variables before use
4. Include print statements for the output
5. Test the function with example input
6. Ensure all code blocks (if/for/while) are properly indented with exactly 4 spaces
7. Do not include explanatory comments or markdown
8. Return only valid, runnable Python code
9. The function must be called at the end of the file
10. All nested code blocks must be indented with an additional 4 spaces
11. The code must be complete and executable when saved to a .py file
12. The output must be printed, not just returned

Example format:
def solve_problem(parameter):
    # Your code here, indented with 4 spaces
    if condition:
        # Nested code indented with 8 spaces
        statement
    print(result)

solve_problem(example_input)
